# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

The Kaonic Serial Number System implements multiple layers of security to protect against various attack vectors and ensure the integrity of serial number data.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Cryptographic Security
- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** using NIST P-256 curve
- **HMAC-SHA256** signatures for client compatibility
- **SHA-256 hashing** for file integrity verification
- **Timestamp-based replay protection** (5-minute window)

### Application Security
- **Rate limiting**: 5 requests per minute per IP (100 for verification)
- **Input validation**: Regex patterns for serial number format
- **SQL injection protection**: Parameterized queries
- **Environment variable configuration**: Sensitive data in `.env` files

### Network Security
- **HTTPS support** for production deployments
- **CORS configuration** for cross-origin requests
- **Request validation** and sanitization

## üîê Key Management

### Private Keys
- **NEVER commit private keys** to version control
- Store private keys in secure, encrypted storage
- Implement key rotation policies
- Use strong entropy for key generation

### Public Keys
- Public keys can be safely committed
- Validate public key format before storage
- Implement key revocation mechanisms

## üö® Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Use strong database passwords**
2. **Enable HTTPS in production**
3. **Regular security updates**
4. **Monitor access logs**
5. **Implement backup strategies**

### For Factory Operators
1. **Secure key storage** on devices
2. **Regular key rotation**
3. **Secure network connections**
4. **Validate server certificates**

### For Developers
1. **Never hardcode secrets**
2. **Use environment variables**
3. **Validate all inputs**
4. **Follow secure coding practices**

## üîç Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainers directly at: [security@kaonic.com]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before public disclosure

### Response Timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Measures

### Input Validation
- Serial number format validation (`K1S-XXXX`)
- File type validation for uploads
- Parameter sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

### Authentication & Authorization
- Cryptographic signature verification
- Factory-specific authentication
- Admin-only endpoints
- Rate limiting per IP

### Data Protection
- Encrypted database connections
- Secure key storage
- Audit logging
- Data integrity checks

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Database security
DB_PASSWORD=strong_password_here

# Key management
FACTORY_KEYS=secure_key_paths

# Rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=5
```

### Production Deployment
- Use HTTPS with valid certificates
- Configure firewall rules
- Enable database encryption
- Implement monitoring and alerting

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Logging
- All authentication attempts
- Failed signature verifications
- Rate limit violations
- Admin actions

### Monitoring
- Unusual access patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- System resource usage
- Database performance

## üöÄ Security Updates

### Regular Updates
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Apply security patches promptly
- Test updates in staging environment

### Key Rotation
- Implement regular key rotation
- Maintain key versioning
- Plan for key recovery
- Document rotation procedures
